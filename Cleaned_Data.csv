101,i really love this app but have one problem that ultimately hurts me and lots of others it automatically shows you the most popular in a reddit rather than the most recent so not enough people see the new ones to make them popular you can set it to where it shows you new ones instead but most either dont know about it or cant be bothered so really good posts get ignored because the ones that get attention are shown to more people instead of the newer ones a lot of the time this isnt a problem but on reddits like writing prompts it can be hard to get the attention you need to get comments that are relevant,New posts have little chance,US,3,2017-07-09,8,32,"(-0.001, 53.0]","(-0.1, 10.0]"

181,ive been using the app since it first came out i love how smooth and natural the interface is the way you dispose of pictures and gifs feels very natural the first flaw i saw with the app was the fact that you couldnt save comments an issue which has since been fixed other than that i find that some navigation is more difficult than it should be on individual posts ive noticed its more difficult to navigate to the parent subreddit or access a user profile because you have to tap on the subreddit name or username this has led to some issues sometimes when i go to collapse comments i will unintentionally access a user profile or vice versa if i want to access a users profile i will accidentally collapse the comment thread im a person with large thumbs so this may be a few and far between issue my original go to reddit app was baconreader which moved the user profile link for each comment into their options button three dots for each comment and post a system which i prefer still the app works great no complaints on performance,"Smooth interface, some minor flaws",US,4,2017-07-08,42,125,"(108.0, 210.0]","(40.0, 50.0]"

773,there are a lot of features to like in this version that ill leave to the five star reviews to gush over   an earlier version called alien blue has one feature that keeps me using it over all the nice features in this version    part of reddits charm are the comments   theyll provide insights wit or counterpoint that sometimes  eclipse the original post they truly make reddit  like comments elsewhere theres lots of chaff that hides the ones that make reddit worthwhile thats where this version fails to breast blue blue enables comment thread collapse with a single tap this version requires two taps   one to open a pop up and another to collapse the thread as odd as it sounds doubling the number of taps takes more than twice as long to effect as a single tap the pop up like all pop ups interrupt the flow as you shift attention from the contents to the pop up pop ups elsewhere are intrusive and this ones no less obnoxious  its a small thing that keeps me favoring blue over this version there are  many terrific features  in this version that i know of and there may be more waiting to be found that will remain unfound until this version has single tap collapse as one of its features,Blue is better in one significant way,US,3,2017-07-02,76,152,"(108.0, 210.0]","(70.0, 80.0]"

2581,i have loved this app ever since it came out well atleast since i found it a few years ago on the web only reddit i have nothing but great things to say the only thing is the banner that comes up in the website when using a mobile or tablet asking to use the app yes i know apps are the way to go but i really think it should be a smaller window just seeing it before it covered 1 4 of my browser or iphone 6 47 inch screen and was a lot of blank background space with that as well i think you should make a dont show me this again square box to tick until that user signs out leaves all the reddit pages or until the browser session is over then its refreshed and will be asked again to try use or download the reddit app   this is not reddit alone at all so any other app developers or people involved in apps phone development and web development you might like to read this  this kind of download use out app advertising on a devices websites that are co using or completely converting to app use in this app phenomenon that is just programs simplified and packed into an application many programs are now listed under applications on different devices with the programs not changing from the program it was rather being re categorised as an application with this there has been a lot of new integration into the web development over the last several years with apps having only exploded a couple of years ago so people companies are really on to it with marketing and over marketing is one thing that this instance does can and will drive some* people away from using the app or the website at the time since a lot of the older users will be adjusting to the change and the simple fact that there just arent features on every app compared to its parent website just like reddit  also for any one making anything digital making everything simple isnt always right having a simple functionality plan is different and if your looking to make an app thats simple then this will be the way to go simply put there needs to be more it cant all be simple a lot of apps as many would have seen with windows 8& 10 in particular is their very bland and ultra basic ways their apps programs work function and look now yet there is still 5 ways to do one simple thing personally i dont like it i prefer windows 7 a lot more im actually planning on going to mac as next pc or laptop anyhow sure some of the new features on w10 are great however with the multi functionality of everything on windows besides third party stuff is becoming more complicated for the average person who didnt have the experience growing up with alt of electronics or technology let alone the technology thats in our faces right now or they just didnt have the want to learn didnt understand why at the time or perhaps the generation gap with some users has made it extremely hard for those who didnt use a lot of technology that are now bis hard to get around with some people thats ok but technology as we or most now becoming forced into having online accounts and signing up to digital content that to some of them ive taught is completely mind boggling for them and i understand why   theres another thing i want to adress  we could be living without energy bills since 1917 search tesla power and why nicolas tesla was assassinated because the power companys coal mining other energy production plants would be out of business or atleast put behind a whole lot youll have to read it yourself if you want to now about it also another thing we know the iphone 9s coming but its already in development they already know what the iphone 10 is more or less going to look like sure the models will vary with consumer criticism  positive or negative  i also want to push the fact that  unless i was to be super picky and leave some constructive criticism which i do from time to time within the apps or websites and for reddit i have and will continue to do so in regards to bugs & other issues update problems suggestions ideas etc   this is what you can expect to read about and shows you that there is so much to learn on reddit   it is the number one source of information genuine information from others   keep up the good work reddit team,Worlds Leading Blog/Forum - Detailed Review,AU,5,2017-06-11,6,18,"(-0.001, 53.0]","(-0.1, 10.0]"
